This library provides a versioning `laravel-nova` mixins dependency for 3rd party packages built for Laravel Nova.

## Why?

`laravel-nova` may introduce breaking and none breaking improvements from time to time. To maintain compatibility all 3rd party packages should rebuild their packages each time Laravel Nova released a new version. 

By skipping this process and depending on the severity of the changes it may result in your application no longer working and you are locked to an older version and have to wait each affecting 3rd packages to update their code.

### Pros

* `nova-kit/nova-packages-tool` reduces the maintaining hurdle for each 3rd party package utilizing `laravel-nova`.
* The `dist` generated file will be reduced since 3rd party package is no longer required to build `laravel-nova` source code.

### Cons

* Each time Laravel Nova made a new release, you need to wait until `nova-kit/nova-packages-tool` make a new compatible release.

## Installation

To install through composer, run the following command from terminal:

```bash 
composer require "nova-kit/nova-packages-tool:^1.0"
```

Next, make sure your application's `composer.json` contains the following command under `script.post-autoload-dump`:

```json
{
  "script" : {
    "post-autoload-dump": [
      "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-assets --ansi --force"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Usages

First, you need to add webpack.external alias to `laravel-nova` and comment the existing reference to `vendor/laravel/nova/resources/js/mixins/js/packages.js` under `nova.mix.js`:

```js

webpackConfig.externals = {
  vue: 'Vue',
  'laravel-nova': 'LaravelNova'
}

// webpackConfig.resolve.alias = {
//   ...(webpackConfig.resolve.alias || {}),
//   'laravel-nova': path.join(
//   __dirname,
//   'vendor/laravel/nova/resources/js/mixins/packages.js'
//   ),
// }
```

This would allow your package to depends on `laravel-nova` from external source and no longer compiled it locally. 

### Theme Switched Event

Instead of manually registering custom `MutationObserver` on each package, you can now listen to a single `nova-theme-switched` event:

```js
Nova.$on('nova-theme-switched', ({ theme, element }) => {
  if (theme === 'dark') {
    element.add('package-dark')
  } else {
    element.remove('package-dark')
  }
})
```

## Nightly Build 

Those who just can't wait for compatible release you have to option to use our nightly build by running the following command on your Laravel Nova application:

```bash 
composer require nova-kit/nova-packages-tool:"dev-next as 1.999.999"
```
